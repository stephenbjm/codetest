Notes for Video Rental Eclipse Project

Please import the project into Eclipse.

The project is hopefully largely self-explanatory :-)!

The DatabaseService class emulates a persistence service using Java maps. A real world example would of course use JPA or some other mechanism.

The model package contains the business entities.

The resources and service packages respectively model the RESTful endpoints and the associated service classes/methods.

I built and tested this Jersey project using Eclipse Kepler Service Release 2 with Postman.
